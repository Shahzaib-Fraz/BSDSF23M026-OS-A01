.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
mycat reads each given filename (or standard input if none provided)
and writes its contents to standard output. This is a demonstration
function used by the client to show file I/O utilities in the MyUtils
library.

The function behaves similarly to the Unix \fBcat\fP utility but is
implemented here as a library routine for demonstration and testing.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success returns 0. On failure returns a non-zero error code and
prints a diagnostic message to standard error.
